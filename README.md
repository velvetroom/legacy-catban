## Description

Kanban board architected for mobile.

■ Organize anything, anywhere. Fast, easy, reliable.

■ Get an overview of your current status.

Every human is different so why not managing your tasks with a tool tailored just for you, by you?

With Catban you define the tasks you need to do as Cards, create Columns to group those Cards accordingly to their current state and update your progress.

Kanban was developed as a scheduling system last century to improve manufacturing efficency. The name comes from the cards that track the production within a factory.

Catban is simple, clean, easy to use. You don't have to learn anything, just download the app and start managing your time.

The interface is the cleanest possible, you can focus on doing things and not in the details.
