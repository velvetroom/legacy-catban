## Description

Clean Architecture is a Framework that will enable a clean separation of concerns in your iOS app;
it is greatly inspired by Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture [Uncle Bob](http://blog.cleancoder.com)


## Rationale

Separating the concerns of your app on the different layers according to their responsibilities will enable you to embrace change and
have a software structre more flexible.


## Motivation

Is common among developers to have the misconception that the structure of an app should be designed before it starts the development
process, even more, there is a trend to consider that this structure should be designed in a way that will enable any new feature to be
added to the app but not changing the structure itself.

These misconception lead to either a pre-design stage that can last ages and will endup with an overengineered structure, hence will make
changes really hard to apply or it will be a very fragile structure where any simple change can lead to many different parts of the system
to break and in need of corrective refactoring.
